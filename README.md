Object

## 6 Main Concepts

### 1. Object

Object has two characteristic:
1. State/Field (Variable and static value) 
2. Behavior (Method - Function in Object)

e.g. 

**Animal**
- State: name, age, phylum
- Behavior: eat, sleep

```Java
public class Animal {
    //These are state of object.
    String name;
    int age;
    String phylum;

    //These are behavior.
    void eat();

    void sleep();
}
```
